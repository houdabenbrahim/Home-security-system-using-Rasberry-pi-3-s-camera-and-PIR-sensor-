# Home-security-system-using-Rasberry-pi-3-s-camera-and-PIR-sensor-
Objective : 
the project is capturing an image when motion is detected with Raspberry Pi camera and sending that image as email notification. I have used python to write the script and have also published it. we must have two emails  (I have used Gmail), to send and receive notification.
Hardware tools : 
•	Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
•	PIR Motion Sensor (generic)
Software tools and online services :
•	2 gmail accounts (send and receive notifications ) 
•	SSH connection 
Schematic :
Steps : 
1.	Connect Pin 3 of Raspberry Pi(5V Power) to the Power pin of the sensor.
2.	Pin 5 of Raspberry Pi (GND) to the GND of the Sensor.
3.	 Pin GPIO23 of Raspberry Pi to the output Pin of the sensor(of course one can use different GPIO but then one should change to Python code)
